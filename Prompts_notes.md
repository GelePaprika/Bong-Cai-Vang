## Prompt: Fix the API from Lovable API to OpenAI API

The published application works correctly, but the local development version does not generate AI responses.

Please investigate why the AI functionality works in the hosted Lovable version but fails when running locally.

Specifically:

 Verify that all required environment variables are documented.

 Check whether .env.local is missing required values.

 Verify the API routes and endpoint configuration.

 Check whether any Lovable-specific services are only available in the hosted environment.

 Ensure the project can be cloned from GitHub, configured with the required environment variables, and run locally without modifying the source code.

If additional setup is required, please create a clear LOCAL_SETUP.md or update the README.md with:

 Required environment variables

 Required API keys

 Required Supabase configuration

 Installation steps

 Commands to run the project locally

 Troubleshooting steps

Please audit the project to ensure it is fully portable. A developer should be able to clone the GitHub repository, configure the documented environment variables, run npm install and npm run dev, and have all features—including AI generation—working locally.
